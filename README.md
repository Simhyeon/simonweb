### How this repository work?

Simple, there are template folder which contains fragments of html files.

I use [rad](https://github.com/simhyeon/r4d) macro to include fragments into a
single file.

You might have guessed it, it is some crude version of template engine. Though
I think using react or other frameworks on par with react would be handy. Yet I
was too busy to learn any of such.
