### How this repository work?

Simple, there are template folder which contains fragments of html files.

I use m4 macro to include fragments into a single.

You might have guessed it, it is some crude version of template engine.

Configuring complete code base for proper template engine for this size of website is a waste of effort, at least I believe so.
