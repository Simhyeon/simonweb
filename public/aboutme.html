				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
				I'm a <strong>desops</strong> engineer and game system designer. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
				You might say "Hol up what is a <strong>desops</strong>?"
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
				Well it's a composite word of "Design" and "Operation". Desops
				is all about integrating a design process and an operation.
				While operation in a game design field is not quite intuitive
				at the first time, however it is not so different from
				traditional meaning of operation.
				</p>
				<p>
				Operation is a task to manage and serve a product. Deploying a
				product into multiple servers, reguarly checking server
				statuses etc. These days, many companies have accepted devops
				process therefore concept and role of pure operation team is not
				quite so distinctive. Still, operation's core part is about
				management and service.
				</p>
				<p>
				So what is an operation in game design? Game design operation
				is about managing and serving game designs to developers. Game
				design has multiple aspects. Firstly, game design is an
				instruction manual. Programmers' and artists' works are defined
				by game designs. At the same time, game design is a
				documentation and history of the game. People refers to game
				design documents to find out why other programmers and artists
				made such work and why it should not be modified or removed or
				even extended.
				</p>
				<h3>Why need desops?</h3>
				<hr/>
				<p>
				Because efficient operation is not easy for game designers.
				Efficient operation should enable continuous integration(CI)
				and continuous deployment(CD) of game designs. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Continuous integration, or CI in short, enables automatic merge
				and test process. With proper CI, multiple author's design
				documents are merged without hassel and gets tested whether the
				final result is valid or correspond to team's requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
				Continuous deployment, or CD in short, enables automatic
				services. Game design should be able to be exported as multiple
				formats and representation styles without designers modifying
				them by hand. Such service should let recipients to easily
				create feedback which can be possibly applied to the original
				design document. 
				</p>

					<figcaption>Desops demo : This is a modified work flow of general game design for desops integration.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				So let's go back to the original question. Why need desops? We
				need desops because desops will do many good things for game
				development teams.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Easy version control of game design documents
					</li>
					<li>
					Dynamic document creation so that designers don't have to
					write same things over and over again
					</li>
					<li>
					Designers can automatically distribute their documents that
					correspond to various requirements without touching
					documents at all
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>What have I done as a game developer?</h2>
				<hr/>
				<h3><strong>As a desops engineer</strong></h3>
				<br/>
				<h4><strong>Gesign editor</strong></h4>
				<a href="https://github.com/simhyeon/gesign" target="_blank">Github</a>
				<figure id="gesign_demo">
					<img style="width: 80%; display:block; margin: auto;" src="./img/gesign_demo.png" alt="Gesign demo image"/>
					<figcaption>Gesign demo: Level manager is outdated because it is older than level.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				Gesign editor is an editor which supports file references
				checking mechanism. In the above demo illustration,
				levelmanager.gdml file is currently outdated. This means that
				files that level manager is referencing has changed but level
				manager did not update its contents. In this case, level
				manager is referencing a level file. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Basic principle of gesign reference check is that parent file
				should be always checked manually if parent's referring files
				or children's content was changed, or children file became
				outdated. For example if level's mechanism changes, it is also
				very natural that level manager's mechanism might change, thus
				designer should check for parent files for further updates.
				</p>
				<p>
				For example, following logic is always applied when checking
				files statuses
				</p>
				<br/>
				<figure id="gesign_flow">
					<img style="width: 70%; margin: auto; display: block;" src="./img/gesign_flow.png" alt="Gesign flow image"/>
					<figcaption>Gesign logic: High level component gets outdated when referring low level components is newer than high level component.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				Gesign is not currently activebly developed because of several
				problems which can not be fixed easily without making
				fundamental changes.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					It is an electron based appliation. Slow and electron's
					spec is far behind latest javascript standard.
					</li>
					<li>
					Gesign's file type only supports gdml format which is a
					yaml file with specific composition. Sometimes you need to
					refer files that is not even a text file however it is not
					possible in current state of the program.
					</li>
					<li>
					Gesign is not an library but pure application which means
					you cannot utilize file reference checking in editors other
					than gesign itself. This is bad for design ergonomics.
					</li>
					<li>
					File's timestamp comparison is platform agonistic.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				These are the reaons why I started to make rif library which
				will be introduced later in this part.
				</p>

				<h4><strong>Gdmarp script</strong></h4>
				<a href="https://github.com/simhyeon/gdmarp" target="_blank">Github</a>
				<br/>
				<figure id="gdmarp_demo">
					<img style="width: 80%; display:block; margin: auto;" src="./img/gdmarp_demo.png" alt="Gdmarp demo image"/>
					<figcaption>Gdmarp demo: Simple markdown file is converted into a pdf or pptx.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				Gdmarp is an automation script which converts .gdt file into a
				varoius game design formes. Gdmarp consists of various unix
				text processing programs such as sed, awk and most importantly
				m4 macro processor. M4 macros are predefined and can be
				expanded into other lengthy texts for proper formatting.
				</p>
				<p>
				Gdmarp is a very versatile script which utilizes features like
				variables, sql macros etc. For example, designers can set
				variable macros and use those macros in the file. If variable
				changes, recompilation will change those file's content in
				final result. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Basic work flow of gdmarp is as follows,
				</p>
				<figure id="gdmarp_flow">
					<img style="display:block; margin:auto; width: 50%;" src="./img/gdmarp_flow.png" alt="Gdmarp flow image"/>
					<figcaption>Gdmarp flow: All processes are doen with simple command 'gdmarp compile'</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				Gdmarp currently support three render formes which are
				representation(pdf, pptx, html), wiki formes (wikitext for
				mediawiki instnace) and webui(with bootstrap css) for game
				UI/UX demonstration.
				</p>
				<p>
				Gdmarp is distributed as docker container and easily integrated
				with CI/CD services such as github actions or travis-ci.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h4><strong>Rif library(WIP)</strong></h4>
				<a href="https://github.com/simhyeon/rif" target="_blank">Github</a>
				<hr/>
				<p>
				Rif is another approach to enable file references checking but
				without external editor. Gesign was a good start however it was
				incomplete in terms of fundamentals that it couldn't be
				extended to higher levels. So I started a new project called
				a rif.
				</p>
				<p>
				Rif's architecture is mostly same with gesign's. However rif
				doesn't have any functionality of file editing. Files'
				timestamps are stored in a separate file called
				<strong>rif.json</strong>. This can enable rif's integration to
				other editors such as vim or vs code, but you can always
				manually set the file's status and use simple editor even
				without integration. 
				</p>
				<hr/>
				<h3>As a game designer</h3>
				<br/>
				<p>
				I have made several games by my hand. Why? Because desops is
				about operating game designs and therefore desops should
				understand feedbacks from recipients which are mostly
				programmers.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h4><strong>Card game: HOMM fan game</strong></h4>
				<figure id="card game demo">
					<img style="width: 80%; display:block; margin: auto;" src="./img/card_game_riddler.png" alt="Card game demo"/>
					<figcaption>Card game demo: I used unity's in-built networking system.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				At the time I first created this game(which was 2017), I had no
				idea what was game engine capable of and I barely understood
				what programming was. Therefore it took several months just to
				make this game. I learnt c# programming language and some
				networking concepts and extracted game assets from a game
				called Heroes of Might and Magic VII. Now, that is not so a
				confident way to make a game, however I was not going to
				publish a game and I liked the game, plus I just needed sample
				resourcese to make my game look a little bit "professional."
				</p>
				<p>
				Making a game was not so easy then, because I hardly knew how
				to program. However it was doable and I learnt that nothing is
				impossible, yet it would take some times at worst.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h4><strong>Tetris game and data oriented</strong></h4>
				<a href="https://github.com/simhyeon/tetrisgame" target="_blank">Github</a>
				<figure id="tetris game demo">
					<img style="width: 40%; margin: auto; display:block;" src="./img/tetris_demo.png" alt="Card game demo"/>
					<figcaption>Tetris game demo: This game was made by data oriented game engine and rust programming language.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				I studied rust language and have been craving for opportunity
				to make game that implements <strong>data oriented
				programming</strong>. Unity was developing their own data
				oriented technology stack but it felt insufficient compared to
				their traditional object oriented stack. So I decided to finally
				start developing when I had found very easy to use command line
				game engine called amethyst.
				</p>
				<p>
				Making a game without object orient programming is very
				refreshing and somewhat confusing experience. Object oriented
				programming is a very concrete implementation of
				programmingmethodology. Any programmers who have used unreal
				engine knows inheirtance is a god sent present. Data oriented
				programming does not have a concept of inheritance nor
				polymorphism. They were born not to deter those concepts
				intentionally but dropped them to gain greater good which is
				<strong>speed</strong>. This philosophy made a whole game
				development process very interesting.
				</p>

				<figure id="tetrisStructrue">
					<img style="width: 80%; display:block; margin: auto;" src="./img/tetris_flow.png" alt="Tetris flow demo"/>
					<figcaption>Simple demonstration of how tetris game works as a data oriented programming pipeline.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				I didn't fully understand data oriented programming on start
				and went through several trial and errors. I'm not going to go
				into details how data oriented programming works, yet I want to
				say that I realized data oriented programming is way better
				than object oriented programming in a long run. (But you can
				find a few trials and errors in my blog post if you want to
				know.)

				<h4><strong>Hand made card game server and clients</strong></h4>
				<a href="https://github.com/simhyeon/cardserver" target="_blank">Github</a>
				<figure id="cardGameServerDemo">
					<img style="width: 80%; display:block; margin: auto;" src="./img/card_game_server.png" alt="Card game server demo"/>
					<figcaption>Card game server/client demo: This time I concentrated on making server and client interaction.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br/>
				<p>
				I wanted to learn how game servers work. There are few open
				source game servers such as nakama. But again I decided make a
				game server from scratch. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I made a game server with rust language and used very
				lightweight http library called warp. I've never learnt about
				websockets thus it started slow, but when I grasped a whole
				idea of websockets and how byte streaming works, only several
				days were required to complete game server.
				</p>
				<p>
				Game client was made with simple html,css,javascript codes. I
				didn't want to put too much time on client since my interest
				was on game server.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h4><strong>Reverse game designs</strong></h4>
				<a href="https://gd.simoncreek.xyz" target="_blank">Game design link</a>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
				I made several reverse game design documents to prepare myself
				for real game designs and to test gdmarp's functionality to
				yield proepr game design documents.
				</p>
				<p>
				All reverse game designs are made with gdmarp. If you're
				interested, follow the link and how it's made of.
